# Work in timezone [https://work-in-timezone.netlify.com](https://work-in-timezone.netlify.com)

1. Quickly share timezones that are compatible with a job offer.
2. Quickly find out if you fulfill the timezone restriction for a job.

## Motivation

I was searching for some remote opportunities and stumbled upon one problem. Some offers are restricted to timezones defined by abbreviations like PST (Pacific Standard Time) or UTC (Universal Coordinated Time) with a times range for example `-02:00 - +02:00`.

That's fine I know what they mean but I wasn't able to quickly visualize them in my mind to find out if I'm eligible to work in given timezones.

So that's why this simple thing was made.
